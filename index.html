                        <p class="section-paragraph">In addition to an interest in Computer Science, I am also
                        really interested in cars, and am also a top 100 player in a video game series called "Forza",
                        which millions of people play. I also enjoy drawing and making unique "skins" for my laptop
                        and other electronics. </p>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">Since coming to Rice, I've participated in a few Hackathons,
                        as well as trading competitions. I have been involved in many clubs, like the Rice Vietnamese
                        Student Association, working to help high school students better understand the college
                        admission process, and more coding related clubs like the Rice Computer Science Club
                        and the Rice Computational Finance Club.</p>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">This past summer, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at
                        eBay, in San Jose, CA. I am looking for internships for Summer 2020.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-title mt-0">My Experience at eBay</h2>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">I worked with the SearchX Team within eBay. They are responsible
                        for the search bar for eBay's main internal website, and also adding features on top of
                        normal search, most notably with a chat box that opens with certain keywords to guide
                        users through common questions/issues that are searched.</p>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">I did a lot of small features and proof of concepts with this
                        team, like creating a Java library to cut down on duplicate code between projects. However,
                        I also worked on two major features, called "Webclip" and "SearchX Admin Page". For Webclip,
                        I worked on initially migrating code so that the chat box that shows up on other eBay websites
                        where the feature would be useful. I worked on this using Angular. For the SearchX Admin page,
                        I created a CRUD web application to allow managers/moderators of SearchX to easily modify the
                        database of users (previously it had to be manually changed in the database). For this feature
                        I worked on it using Angular, Node.js, Java Spring, and MongoDB.</p>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">I also talked to other teams and gave them suggestions, as well as
                            submitting over 10 production bug reports for the main eBay website.

                        <p class="section-paragraph">I worked on a few projects for hackathons and trading competitions,
                        but I also worked on a few projects on my own, most notably my "CARma Reviews" project. This is
                        a car review aggregator (like Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes) as well as a social media website.
                        The basic idea is that data will be gathered from various car review websites, and their scores
                        will be combined to determine a winner, in a hopefully less biased selection. Users can discuss
                        about various vehicles. Users can also adjust the weighting for various car reviewers, to better
                        match the score to their personal preferences. The intention of this tool is to help people to
                        buy a car as objectively as possible.</p>
